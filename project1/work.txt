Simon:
- I almost finished task a). The Calculation of the Beta coefficients works as it should, so you should be able to use it.
I have not yet implemented calculation of the MSE, if you want to, you can. I had to fix a rather stupid bug, that's why I took so much time.
I will finish this later tonight!

can be found in your small_function_library.py-file.

- I found a bug (the (x,y) data wasn't randomly distributed during setup) and fixed it.

- I "kinda" finished b), but there's a persistent bug (Variance & bias are far too high) I don't know how to fix.
