Simon:
- I almost finished task a). The Calculation of the Beta coefficients works as it should, so you should be able to use it.
I have not yet implemented calculation of the MSE, if you want to, you can. I had to fix a rather stupid bug, that's why I took so much time.
I will finish this later tonight!

Simon:
- Task a) finished. I added a function to create the design matrix up to degree deg for two parameters x and y. This
can be found in your small_function_library.py-file.

Monday 7th, 13:45
- I found a bug (the (x,y) data wasn't randomly distributed during setup) and fixed it.
Monday 7th, 15:45
- I "kinda" finished b), but there's a persistent bug (Variance & bias are far too high) I don't know how to fix.

Thuesday 8th 21:35
- Found a bug in a) that leads to Inversion of a singular matrix when the sample number is small (tried 10 i think)
	Shouldn't be a problem for the work we're doing, but if something pops up later, it might be worth a closer
	look. Also, it might be a problem if we're comparing the methods for smaller and smaller sample sizes,
	like kfoldCross vs Bootstrap

Wednesday 23rd
- I wrote about the Bias-Variance tradeoff. Only the proof is left now. 
- I finally fixed, for good this time, the bug with scaling. The problem was that in Python, I technically didn't copy the array, but created a new array object. This lead to some rather weird behaviour. Fixing that was surprisingly easy.
- I plotted MSE for all 3 methods, both in the Korea picture and in the Franke Function, both K-Fold and "normal"
- I found good parameters that give reasonable results in terms of LASSO. For the FRANKE function, sigma = 0.05 gives superb data, a lasso tolerance of 0.03, and 10^5 lasso iterations are good data, as well as 500 data points. I recommend using that for all future data. SEED: CORONA (just gives a "neat" function lol)
- I finished a, d and e (I made a new file d2 because I didn't want to touch yours) creating plots for the bias-variance tradeoff. 
- Later, I will start two programs at home that need to run over night (very many bootstraps). As I'm positive that my program does what it is supposed to, this will give nice "final" data. 
- Code-wise, the only thing left, really, is the bias-variance-tradeoff for the picture for all three methods, and of course, create other plots we are interested in. I might start writing on the results part of the report tomorrow, maybe the weekend, maybe next week. And make test functions. And some annoying fine-tuning. But I think we're good in time!!

Friday 25th
All mandatory analysis for the Franke function is done, EXCEPT for the variance of the parameters. I would love you if you did that and put it in the result part. 
Other things missing:
- Different values for k in Crossfold. Only analysing for OLS should be enough here.
- The ideal lambda parameter. You started on that
- The same thing for the geographic data. I have already done a lot here, so the bias-variance-tradeoff here is simply a "rip off" of the stuff I already implemented. An error analysis for the three methods file is already created, it only needs to be run over night one day. I might do that on Saturday -> Sunday (comments on that, please!).
- Write more in the theory and methods part
I think we're good. :)
