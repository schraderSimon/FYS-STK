Simon:
- I almost finished task a). The Calculation of the Beta coefficients works as it should, so you should be able to use it.
I have not yet implemented calculation of the MSE, if you want to, you can. I had to fix a rather stupid bug, that's why I took so much time.
I will finish this later tonight!
